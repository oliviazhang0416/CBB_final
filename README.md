# CBB_final

This folder contains the code for the final project. 

We developed a Batch-Constrained Deep Q-learning (BCQ, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm) (Fujimoto et al., 2019) based artificial intelligence clinician.

main.py: includes the main function to train BCQ

memory.py: includes the function for experience replay buffer

loss.py: define loss function

function.py: define functions for VAE, Critic network, Actor network, etc.

evaluation.py: define functions for BCQ evaluation
